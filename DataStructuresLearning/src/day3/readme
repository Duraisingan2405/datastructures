Coding Exercise - Two Sum
Question:

Two Sum - You are given an array of Integers and another integer targetValue.
 Write a function that will take these inputs and return the indices of the 2
  integers in the array that add up targetValue.


  our motive is to find the indexes of two elements in the test array
  which forms the given target number as the result.
  if it not found means return an empty array.

  first solution:
    this one is the normal implementation without taken into considering
    the time complexity which is of the order of O(n^2)

  second solution:
    we provided the solution above with the time complexity of O(n^2)
    so optimised in the second solution with the help of hashtable to look up the value
    this solution is optimised to timeComplexity of O(n) and the space complexity of O(n) for the worst case it will take the space
    complexity of 0(n) say example if the pair may not found
