Question 1: Permutations - Given an array of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations.
You can return the answer in any order.
  in our approach we will use recurion to solve the permutations

  the solved problem having the time complexity of O(n! * n) -> n! for recursion and n is for loop we are using for loop n! times i.e 6 times for length of 3

  the space complexity is same as the time complextity we are creating the array of (n! * n) times
