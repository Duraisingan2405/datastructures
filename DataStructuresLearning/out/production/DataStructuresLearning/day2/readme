Rotating an array towards the right
normal impl
  if the rotation is 5 and the length is also 5 means the array came to the original position again so we need to find the modulo rotaio only which is often less than the
  length of the array

  [1,2,3,4,5]
  k = 2
  [5,1,2,3,4]
  [4,5,1,2,3]  //copy 4 5 because the k is 2
  shift the remaining elements [1,2,1,2,3,4]
  adding from temp array [4,5,1,2,3,4]
  for the normal implementation it takes the time complexity of O(n) and the space complexity of 0(k) k order of rotation

optimised implementation
  it takes the time complexity of same as 0(n) and the space complexity of O(1) no auxillary space is used
  [1,2,3,4,5]

  step 1
  reverse the arrary [5,4,3,2,1]
  step 2
  k = 3 so [4,5,3,2,1]
  step 3
  reverse remaining
  [4,5,1,2,3]
