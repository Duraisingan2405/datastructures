Rotating an array towards the right
normal impl
  if the rotaion is 5 and the length is also 5 means the array came to the original position again so we need to find the modulo rotaio only which is often less than the
  length of the array

  [1,2,3,4,5]
  k = 2
  [5,1,2,3,4]
  [4,5,1,2,3]  //copy 4 5 because the k is 2
  shift the remaining elements [1,2,1,2,3,4]
  adding from temp array [4,5,1,2,3,4]
