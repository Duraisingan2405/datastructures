ASymptotoic analysis:
  What the runtime of the algorithum grows when the input size increases that is known as asymptotic analysis.
  Asymptotic analyisis can be expressed in big o notation

  we are intrested only in the general trend not about the precision

  o(N) linear time complexity.

  O(n) notation is used to do asymptotic analysis

  we are only intrested in trend.

  means how the algorithum will react when the n tends to infinitivie or n tends to very large


what is Big o

  O(N) -> operations is bounded by a multiple of N

 Big O Notation is the mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the function tends to inifinitive or larger value.

 we will always consider the upper bound or wrost case


 Big o notation is used to express the asymptotic analysis


Common complexities

  O(1)   -> constant

  O(log n)  -> Binary search algorithum  cuts every half of the input at the each step

  O(n)    -> tarverse elements of array to add them

  O(nlog n)  -> merge sort

  O(n^2)   -> [1,2,3] =>permutations

  O(2^n)  -> Fibonacci

  O(n!)

 Space Complexity

   How much auxillary mempry needed to run the alorithum

   we actually ignore the iniput size of the algorithum

   we can impore the time complexity by introducing some addtional space ex:Array


 Logarithms


   in coding log always take the base 2.


  Relation between N and logN


 N    | logn
 1024 | 10   2 pow 10 = 1024
 1048576| 20  2 pow 20


for space complexity of the recursive functions is o(logn)


in Sorted square Array normal impl has the time complexity of O(nlog n) for sorting and iterating over to squaring

we are optimised that to O(n) using left and right pointers the important thing is the array must be given sorted i.e the problem
constrain
