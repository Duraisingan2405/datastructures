Coding Exercise - Two Sum
Question:

Two Sum - You are given an array of Integers and another integer targetValue.
 Write a function that will take these inputs and return the indices of the 2
  integers in the array that add up targetValue.


  our motive is to find the indexes of two elements in the test array
  which forms the given target number as the result.
  if it not found means return an empty array.

  first solution:
    this one is the normal implementation without taken into considering
    the time complexity which is of the order of O(n^2)

  second solution:
