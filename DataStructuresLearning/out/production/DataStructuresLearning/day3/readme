Coding Exercise - Two Sum
Question:

Two Sum - You are given an array of Integers and another integer targetValue.
 Write a function that will take these inputs and return the indices of the 2
  integers in the array that add up targetValue.


  our motive is to find the indexes of two elements in the test array
  which forms the given target number as the result.
  if it not found means return an empty array.

  first solution:
    this one is the normal implementation without taken into considering
    the time complexity which is of the order of O(n^2)

  second solution:
    we provided the solution above with the time complexity of O(n^2)
    so optimised in the second solution with the help of hashtable to look up the value
    this solution is optimised to timeComplexity of O(n) and the space complexity of O(n) for the worst case it will take the space
    complexity of 0(n) say example if the pair may not found


Coding Exercise - Isomorphic Strings
Question:2

Isomorphic Strings - Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters.
 No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
  s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

  what is iso morphic

  s1 = "abacus"
  s2 = "rirfgs"
  a -> r
  b -> i
  a -> r //a again map to the r so valid
  c -> f
  u -> g
  s -> s // self map allowded

  if the length is different it is not valid

  s1 = "aba"
  s2 = "pqr"
  a -> p
  b -> q
  a -> r // a again mapped with r it is not iso morphic

  here when come to the normal implentation without using any data structure it seems to be more complex

  providing optimised solution with hashtables can take the timecomplexity to O(n)
  and space complexity is O(1) it is mentioned that s1 and s2 is a ascii value so fixed its size will be upto 128 only
